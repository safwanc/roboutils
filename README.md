# roboutils
Various MATLAB functions, scripts and classes written for common robotics computations: 

## kinematics
- `JacobianRevolute` - linear/angular velocity jacobian for revolute joint
- `JacobianPrismatic` - linear/angular velocity jacobian for prismatic joint

## linear algebra
- `SkewSymmetric` - returns 3x3 skew symmetric matrix for a 3x1 vector
- `SingularityRobustInverse` - returns the SR-inverse of a non-square matrix (alternative to pseudoinverse)
